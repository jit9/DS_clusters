cluster project for DS

Order of processing:
1. make postages stamps;  need to select the list of cluster locations and to select CMB map to be used (array, season, etc)
2. edit individual postage stamp files so they are uniform length (some seem to get messed up)
3. run plotFits_stack.py to create the stack
4. run profiles to calculate the profile of the stack around the center of the cluster stack.
